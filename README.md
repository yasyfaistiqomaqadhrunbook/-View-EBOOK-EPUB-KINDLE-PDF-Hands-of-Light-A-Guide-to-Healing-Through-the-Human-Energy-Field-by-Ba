With the clarity of a physicist and the compassion of a gifted healer with fifteen years of professional experience observing 5,000 clients and students, Barbara Ann Brennan presents the first in-depth study of the human energy field for people who seek happiness, health and their full potential.

Our physical bodies exist within a larger "body," a human energy field or aura, which is the vehicle through which we create our experience of reality, including health and illness. It is through this energy field that we have the power to heal ourselves.

This energy body -- only recently verified by scientists, but long known to healers

Title: Well written, don‚Äôt be intimidated by the credentials she has. Everyone has access to this ability
Date: Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on December 5, 2022
Review: It‚Äôs a really good book and I‚Äôm learning a lot from it. You kind of get the idea that she is still afraid of people not trusting in her so she seems a little hesitant and really pushes her credentials and the need for you to have credentials in order to become a valid healer. That‚Äôs just her life experience and it‚Äôs great information and you can cherry pick from what resonates with you

Review: I was blown away by the depth & detail of information in this book. It did kind of overwhelm me in that I wondered how I‚Äôd ever be able to ‚Äúsee‚Äù what dad sees and understands.

My only objection: Book is missing Figures 7-2 thru 7-6. And they are crucial to me to visualizing what it is I am seeing (which chakra/layer am I seeing?). I think I‚Äôm seeing from inside out instead of outside in as most ppl do, so the pictures will help me distinguish & be able to move Mu focus‚Äîhopefully.

This is really a printing problem so I‚Äôm not sure how I can solve it. I‚Äôve had the book too long to return.

Title: Rather quacky, I'm afraid.
Date: Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on September 1, 2013
Review: I have a very open mind for spiritual and energetic viewpoints. I practice bodily energy development through regular exercises like Chi Gung and through good nutrition, and I practice spiritual insights through very old meditation techniques, all of which have produced some exciting states of mind and have reinforced excellent physical health.

However, I think Ms. Brennan goes off the deep end with a lot of her nonchalant claims of having extraordinary powers, such as being able to just look at a person and see the cells of a previous miscarriage, as she starts her book out claiming. To quote: "..using my High Sense Perception(HSP)..I 'saw' some abnormal cells inside the uterus on the lower left side. At the same time I 'saw' the circumstances around the miscarriage, the abnormal cells were located where the placenta had been attached." So she claims she can 'see' inside a uterus and 'see' where a placenta from a previous miscarriage had previously been attached.

Well that is extremely suspect, to claim that one can see the cells of miscarriages, and this, as she states, was in 1984!! Wow, so don't you think someone with such miraculous powers would be world famous by now, healing everyone in sight with just a gesture?

The rest of the book follows that same "gee whiz" structure of sharing with the reader the exact "observations" which always support her claims, such as charts of auras, charts of chakras, energy color effects and their frequency levels. She argues points, such as claiming that there is an "energy connection" between people, by saying things like "Mothers know if their children are in danger, even if they are far away". That's absurd, even if a mother guesses something might be dangerous to her child, we all know that many other mothers have had no idea that a tragedy had occurred to their children until they were told about it by someone else.

In her book Ms Brennan states very New Age concepts, like the soul leaves the dying body through the crown energy center and this is what gives people the "traveling through a tunnel" feeling which some in near death experiences have supposedly reported. But this "tunnel" idea is very new, probably never referred to before the 1980's, and probably just a product of pop entertainment movies. If it were really so universal and true, then literature through hundreds of years would be filled with such references like "..and to go through that tunnel which we know leads to the far beyond...". And yet there is not such a concept repeated though historical writing, that's because it's a New Age pop culture idea, one which Brennan embarrassingly accounts for by saying that going through the head chakra gives a round, tunnel like sensation! And how would she know that?

Also she says she can see people dying and being helped by energy people "on the other side". I find this claim to be outrageous. I find her charts, her trite claims about seeing miscarriage cells in a uterus with bare eyes, and much more, to be totally irresponsible things to write in a book.

On page 105 there are about 20 pictures of people with "energy" around them that is in different supposed shapes (shapes which she has given names to like "porcupine", "hysteria", and "tentacles" shape), then on the next few pages there are very complicated indexes cross referencing columns like 'schizophrenic' and 'masochistic' with rows like 'arrested development', 'sexuality', 'negative intent' and 'demands to the right to...".

You can clearly see the contorted New Age imagination run wild that is cross imposed on outdated and dis-proven Freudian make believe.

Add in the pretty charts and the claims of magic sight and you have a severely quacky book here.

As I said at the outset, I do cultivate bodily 'energy' through breathing and physical exercises, in my case I practice Chi Gung, but there are others like Yoga, and Tai Chi. And I can feel healthy vibrations and energies coming from healthy and upbeat people and animals, and healthy plants too for that matter. Plus I know there are massage techniques and mindfulness focus techniques which can have energizing and health/happiness creating effects on people.

But all those things are very normal and can be practiced daily by anyone. These claims in Ms. Brenan's books about magic sight and intricate energy "shapes" that reveal twisted Freudian charts of personality construction, plus seeing energy people and "souls" going to energy lands where they are taken care of in hospitals before being reincarnated again (as Ms. Brennan claims she has seen in this book), I think are absurd, completely imaginary, and even irresponsible in making such outrageous spiritual claims.

I'd like to see a book on healthy bodily energy development and bio-energy direction which is not dripping with childish connections to imaginary or pop culture visual imagery, and which does not attempt to delve into long, contorted personality analysis or side stories along the lines of "a person with this kind of energy likes acceptance and warm hugs, and dislikes having their rights questioned and might develop a greedy personality.", which are littered throughout this book.

I am definitely returning this collection of imaginary concepts to Amazon, and I would only recommend reading this book on the same level as I would recommend a Dungeons and Dragons manual that catalogs the different spells which you can use in the game.

Title: Accurate, but could do without the scientific babble and Brennan's psychic training empire
Date: Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on May 15, 2018
Review: This book is useful if you already have psychic ability, but don't buy into her marketing that you can develop it to her level. You can't. You're born with psychism. You either have it or you don't. If you don't already see auras then you're not going to develop full on aura vision by studying this material. If you're already psychic, then this book sheds light on a lot of useful information. I have never seen such accurate aura diagrams or descriptions of why auras behave the way they do. Her study on this topic has been very thorough.

From everything I know and have experienced personally, this book is very accurate. Some of it is going to be interpretive because Brennan is just one person and she doesn't represent the full world of psychic mediumship -- but nonetheless, her descriptions are the most accurate I have seen in modern published material. Often, new agers write books about mediumship, but they themselves have no real talent. As a result their information misleads others. Brennan's info is reliable.

She gets demerits from me for two reasons. The first and most important is that her course-work empire has become disgustingly bloated and, as is typical of many American business practices, she has become a mogul. She's less accessible now than in her humble beginnings and her celebrity status makes me question her spiritual integrity a little bit. Through the material in this book, she holds expensive weekend workshops with various levels of graduation to psychic hopefuls who want to "heal" others with these new abilities. But they're all being duped. If you aren't a born medium then you'll never be one.

The other demerit is that in the book, she can get very technical and heady. I didn't care for all the talk about NASA, frequencies and wavelengths. I'm psychic so you don't need to validate your perceptions to me. Just tell me what they are and I'll know if you're a faker or not. Fortunately, she is not a faker, but I could have done without all the scientific babble. Scientists don't believe psychics are real anyway so who cares.

Review: This book is written with such great explanations and examples that I felt like I've know this all along. I was born with my gifts and just recently started to focus on what's outside of 3D and to focus on strengthening my gifts. Thanks to this book, I learned how to see auras by page 40. ‚ô°
